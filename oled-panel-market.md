<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The OLED Panel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Matrix</li><li>Passive Matrix</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The OLED panel market is primarily divided into two types: Active Matrix OLED (AMOLED) and Passive Matrix OLED (PMOLED). AMOLED utilizes a matrix of thin-film transistors to control individual pixels, enabling higher resolution and faster refresh rates, making it ideal for smartphones and televisions. PMOLED, on the other hand, operates simpler by controlling rows and columns of pixels, which limits resolution and size but is more cost-effective for smaller displays like wearables. Each type serves distinct applications based on performance and pricing needs.</p></p>
