<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Antacids Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Systemic Antacids</li><li>Systemic Antacids</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The antacids market is segmented into non-systemic and systemic antacids. Non-systemic antacids neutralize stomach acid locally without significant systemic absorption, providing rapid relief from heartburn and indigestion. Common examples include aluminum hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide. In contrast, systemic antacids, such as sodium bicarbonate, can affect the entire body because they are absorbed into the bloodstream, offering longer-lasting effects but potentially causing electrolyte imbalances. Both types are essential in managing gastrointestinal discomfort and promoting digestive health.</p></p>
